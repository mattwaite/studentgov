This is a project by two students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to track the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska (ASUN), the student government at UNL. We're aiming to make it generic enough to be of use at any university. 

This project is the work of Andrew McClure and Marcus Scheer as part of an independent study class with Matt Waite. Bully!
